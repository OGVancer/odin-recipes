        <h1>Recipe Description</h1>
        <p>A salmon fritter recipe that my dad used to make on the occasional Sunday. It's adapted from fried Caribbean accras made from salted cod. I didn't have salted cod, so I substituted canned sockeye salmon, and it turned out awesome.</p>

        <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 (14.75 ounce) cans salmon, drained and flaked</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together flour, parsley, baking powder, salt, thyme, and cumin in a large bowl. Add chopped onion and jalapeño pepper; mix until incorporated. Add salmon and eggs; mash salmon and mix until combined. Add water and stir until a thick batter forms.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a frying pan just below the medium heat setting.</li>
            <li>Working in batches of 3, drop 1 tablespoonful scoops of batter per fritter into hot oil; fry until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batter for about 16 fritters in total.</li>
        </ol>
